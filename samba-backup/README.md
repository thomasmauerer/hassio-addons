Create snapshots and store them on a Samba share.

## About

This add-on lets you automatically create Home Assistant snapshots and store them on a Samba share. This does work with Samba shares that require authentication by username/password or allow guest access.

## Installation

1. Navigate in your Home Assistant frontend to **Supervisor** -> **Add-on Store** and add this URL as an additional repository: `https://github.com/thomasmauerer/hassio-addons`
2. Find the "Samba Backup" add-on and click the "INSTALL" button.
3. Configure the add-on and click on "START".

## Configuration

The `host` and the `share` parameters are always required. If you do not specify any username and password, the Samba share has to be configured to allow guest access for this to work.

|Parameter|Required|Description|
|---------|--------|-----------|
|`host`|Yes|The hostname/URL of the Samba share.|
|`share`|Yes|The name of the Samba share.|
|`target_dir`|No|The target directory on the Samba share. If not specified the snapshots will be stored in the root directory.|
|`username`|No|The username to access the Samba share.|
|`password`|No|The password to access the Samba share.|
|`keep_local`|Yes|The number of local snapshots to be preserved. Set `all` if you do not want to delete any snapshots. Note that this will also delete snapshots that were not created with this add-on.|
|`keep_remote`|Yes|The number of snapshots to be preserved on the Samba share. Set `all` if you do not want to delete any snapshots.|
|`trigger_time`|Yes|The time when to automatically trigger a backup. See below for advanced options.|
|`trigger_days`|Yes|The days on which a backup will be triggered.|
|`exclude_addons`|No|The slugs of add-ons to exclude in the snapshot. This will trigger a partial snapshot if specified. You can find out the correct slugs by clicking on an installed add-on and looking at the URL e.g. `core_ssh`.|
|`exclude_folders`|No|The folders to exclude in the snapshot. This will trigger a partial snapshot if specified. Possible values are `homeassistant`, `ssl`, `share` and `addons/local`.|
|`backup_name`|No|The custom name for the snapshots. See below for advanced options.|
|`backup_password`|No|If specified the snapshots will be password-protected.|
|`log_level`|No|Control the verbosity of log output produced by this add-on. Possible values are `debug`, `info` (default), `warning` and `error`.|

_Example configuration_:
```json
{
  "host": "192.168.178.100",
  "share": "my-share",
  "target_dir": "backups/ha-backups",
  "username": "my-user",
  "password": "my-password",
  "keep_local": "14",
  "keep_remote": "30",
  "trigger_time": "04:00",
  "trigger_days": ["Mon","Tue","Wed","Thu","Fri","Sat","Sun"],
  "exclude_addons": ["core_ssh", "core_duckdns"],
  "exclude_folders": ["share"],
  "backup_name": "{type} Snapshot (Samba Backup) {date}",
  "backup_password": "my-$tr0nG-pwd",
  "log_level": "debug"
}
```

### What if I don't like the names of the snapshots?

No problem, you can customize the names with the `backup_name` variable. You can either use a fixed text or include the following name patterns which will automatically be converted to its real values.

- `{type}`: Full or Partial
- `{version}`: The current version of Home Assistant
- `{date}`: The current date and timestamp

_Example_: "{type} Snapshot {version} {date}" might end up as "Full Snapshot 0.110.4 2020-06-05 12:00"


### What if the supported triggers do not suit my needs?

Maybe you want some advanced trigger based on a specific Home Assistant event instead of a fixed time schedule? No problem, you can still create your own Home Assistant automation to trigger this add-on. You just have to do two things:

1. Set `trigger_time` to `manual`
2. Include the following in your automation.yaml

```
service: hassio.addon_stdin
data:
  addon: 15d21743_samba_backup
  input: trigger
```

### Status notifications

This add-on will automatically publish its current status via mqtt on topic `samba_backup/status` if a mqtt broker is present on your device. You can install the `Mosquitto broker` add-on for example. Note that this feature does currently not work with external brokers! If you are using an Access Control List, make sure to add the following two lines. Otherwise you won't receive anything on the mqtt topic:

```
user addons
topic readwrite samba_backup/#
```

The status will be one of the following:

- `IDLE`: Samba Backup is waiting for the trigger
- `RUNNING`: A backup is currently in progress
- `SUCCEEDED`: The backup was successful
- `FAILED`: The backup was not successful

You can use this information in Home Assistant. For example you could send out a notification if a backup failed. Just configure a mqtt sensor and use it in an automation.

```yaml
sensor:
- platform: mqtt
  name: "Samba Backup"
  state_topic: "samba_backup/status"
```
Note that a failed backup will also exit the entire add-on. Please check the logs in that case and restart the add-on.

## Credits
This add-on is inspired by [hassio-remote-backup](https://github.com/overkill32/hassio-remote-backup), but does not require a ssh connection and also offers more features.
